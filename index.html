<p> Muhammad Ali known as Ali Sadpara[1] (born February 2, 1976; missing since 5 February 2021)[2] is a Pakistani mountaineer. He was part of the team that successfully achieved the first ever winter summit on Nanga Parbat in 2016.[3] Both his teammates, Alex Txikon and Simone Moro, have gone on record stating that they could not have done it without Sadpara's brilliance. He had successfully climbed four eight-thousanders in a calendar year and a total of eight in his career.[4]

    Sadpara and his 21-year-old son Sajid Sadpara, who had climbed K2 in 2019, 
    teamed up with Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurj√≥nsson[5] and Chilean mountaineer Juan Pablo Mohr
     Prieto[6] for a joint K2 ascent, leaving the highest camp on the evening of February 4, 2021. Sajid had to 
     descend due to a technical issue, leaving the others at the Bottleneck, close to the summit. 
     His father, Snorri, and Mohr kept climbing up, but they didn't come back by night as planned. 
     A rescue mission with two army helicopters was organized on February 6. 
    The three climbers are still missing.[7]</p>
